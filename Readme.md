# Introduction 
The Appliances Energy Prediction dataset provides valuable insights into the energy consumption of appliances in a house over a span of 4.5 months. The dataset combines information on temperature, humidity, weather conditions, and energy usage, gathered through a ZigBee wireless sensor network and energy meters. By analyzing this dataset, we can understand the factors influencing energy consumption and predict the energy consumption. The dataset contains variables such as temperature, humidity, and energy usage in different rooms, as well as external weather data. This analysis aims to enhance energy efficiency and inform energy management strategies in residential settings based on a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
